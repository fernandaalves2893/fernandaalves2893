## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Fernanda Gabriela, but you can call me **Fernanda**. ðŸ˜˜

My pronouns are _she/her_ (but I really don't care, you can call me he/him as wellðŸ¤—)

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a **elementary school teacher**...

I am learning **programming languages** and other skills: *excel, react, data, SQL, etc.*, because I am trying to change careers.
My focus is on **Frontend development**, but **I am open to learn anything** (I believe I am a fast learner)

Up to now I only have a few sites I developed with the help of Alura Courses, but soon enough I'll present different things (**baby steps**)

I can summarize the reasons why I am here in three points:

1st: I am a Teacher, but I realized I needed a change. The field of Dev and Data looked like a nice option to change careers.

2nd: Learning to program is fascinating. I love each step of the process, and I can say it's amazing to see the magic happening.

3rd: The opportunities seem attractive.
